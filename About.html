            <div>
                <p>The Unified Internship Program (UIP), founded in 2019 as part of the Australia Learning System (ALS), began by arranging internships for graduating students. The COVID-19 pandemic, however, necessitated a significant shift.</p>
                
                <p>UIP transformed into a fully online, non-profit organization, now specializing in work-from-home internships. This adaptation allowed the program to continue meeting student and institutional needs through online connections while maintaining efficiency with our highly committed team.</p>
