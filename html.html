                                    These terms and conditions of use ("Terms") constitute a legal agreement between you, the UIP and its partnered companies (referred to in these Terms & Conditions as "us," "we," or "our"), the providers of the Internship Unified Program Website (which are collectively referred to in these Terms & Conditions as the "Internship Unified Program Services").

                                    In consideration of your use of the Site, you agree to (a) provide accurate, current, and complete information about yourself as may be prompted by any registration forms on the Site ("Registration Data"); (b) maintain and promptly update the Registration Form, and any other information you provide to the UIP, to keep it accurate, current, and complete; (c) maintain the security of your password and identification; (d) notify UIP admins immediately of any unauthorized use of your account or any other breach of security; (e) accept all responsibility for any and all activities that occur under your account; and (f) accept all risks of unauthorized access to the Registration Data and any other information you provide to the UIP.

                                    <strong>Most Important Terms & Conditions for the Unified Internship Program and Partnered Companies</strong><br>
                                    These Terms, specifically for the Unified Internship Program and its partnered companies, are in addition to the other generic Terms & Conditions listed on the page, which are common to all users of the site and which you are required to go through. Any violation of these Terms may result in,
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>Accepting of Applicants T&Cs:</strong><br>
                                    1. Any assignment(s) that we may give to applicants to assess their suitability for the Job should be fair and relevant to the job profile.<br>
                                    2. All our communications with applicants (through email, discord chat, or otherwise) should be professional and must not contain any obscene or offensive content.<br>
                                    3. Once we hire any applicant(s) for our job, we must provide them with an acceptance letter clearly detailing all the important details (such as role & responsibilities, starting date, and complete address and contact details of the company’s organization).<br>
                                    4. If we come across any suspicious activity, content, or behavior on the UIP website by an applicant or another user, we will immediately take any necessary actions that can be taken.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>Applicant data usage T&Cs:</strong><br>
                                    1. You can use the applicants' data that you receive for your job solely for the purpose of hiring. Any attempt to send any other communication (promotional content, for example) to the applicants or any other usage of the data is strictly prohibited.<br>
                                    2. The Unified Internship Program and its partnered companies are strictly prohibited from transferring/selling/sharing applicants' data to any other entity. Any such attempt would be liable for legal action against the organization.
                                    <br><br>
                                    <strong>Terms & Conditions for Applicants</strong><br>
                                    These Terms, specifically for applicants, are in addition to the other generic Terms & Conditions listed on the page, which are common to all users of the site and which you are required to go through. Any violation of these TERMS & CONDITIONS may result in, but is not limited to, an applicant's application being declined and/or terminated and/or suitable legal action being initiated against him/her by the Unified Internship Program and its partnered companies.
                                    If you have applied for an internship on the Unified Internship Program (UIP) website, once your application status has been approved or received an acceptance letter from the Unified Internship Program regarding your application, you must attend the onboarding seminar.
                                    Once you are part of the internship program, you must make every possible effort to join and start your task on time. Not showing up or habitual absenteeism creates poor morale and reduces the credibility of the UIP community at large. Any such behavior will not only result in your termination or dismissal from the Unified Internship Program and its partnered companies, but we will also report it to your college administration wherever applicable.
                                    <br><br>
                                    You must provide accurate and complete information at the time of creating an account on the Unified Internship Program (UIP). Any misrepresentation of information, hiding of material information, or impersonation would result in your application being declined on the site, and you being reported to your college administration wherever applicable.
