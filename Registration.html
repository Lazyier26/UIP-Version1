                    <p>
                        These Terms, specifically for applicants, are in addition to the other generic Terms &amp; Conditions listed on the page, which are common to all users of the site and which you are required to go through.

                        <li>If you have applied for an internship on the Unified Internship Program (UIP) website, once your application status has been approved or received an acceptance letter from the Unified Internship Program regarding your application, you must attend the onboarding seminar.</li>
                        <li>Once you are part of the internship program, you must make every possible effort to join and start your task on time.

Any such attempt would result in your termination and/or permanent blocking and would be liable for legal action against you.</li>
                        <li>The Unified Internship Program (UIP) focuses on cultivating and sustaining a diverse internship environment and culture and maximizing interns' potential by expanding professional opportunities through learning and development.</li>
                        <li>You agree to have gone through the 'Onboarding Process" of these Terms and have understood the same.</li>
                        <li>While it is our endeavor to provide you with accurate and reliable information, it is always possible for an error to occur. Hence, you must conduct your own due diligence and research about your job/role and take full responsibility for the same. You further agree to have read and understood the 'Disclaimers' section of these Terms and explicitly and specifically agree to it.</li>
                        <li>If you come across any suspicious activity, content, or behavior on the Unified Internship Program (UIP) by an admin or another user, you must report it to the Unified Internship Program immediately so that necessary actions can be taken.
